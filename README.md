<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

There are many great README templates available on GitHub; however, I didn't find one that really suited my needs so I created this enhanced one. I want to create a README template so amazing that it'll be the last one you ever need -- I think this is it.

Here's why:
* Your time should be focused on creating something amazing. A project that solves a problem and helps others
* You shouldn't be doing the same tasks over and over like creating a README from scratch
* You should implement DRY principles to the rest of your life :smile:

Of course, no one template will serve all projects since your needs may be different. So I'll be adding more in the near future. You may also suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue. Thanks to all the people have contributed to expanding this template!

Use the `BLANK_README.md` to get started.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

This is an example of how you may give instructions on setting up your project locally.
To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites

This is an example of how to list things you need to use the software and how to install them.
* pip
  ```sh
  pip install -r requirements
  ```

### Installation

_Below is an example of how you can instruct your audience on installing and setting up your app. This template doesn't rely on any external dependencies or services._

1. Run Jupyter notebook on Sagemaker at [https://bcg-rise-bda.awsapps.com/start#/](https://bcg-rise-bda.awsapps.com/start#/)
2. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/JohnTan38/Best-README.git
   ```
3. Install packages
   ```sh
   pip install mlxtend
   ```
4. Import libraries
   ```python
   from mlxtend.frequent_patterns import apriori, association_rules
   from mlxtend.preprocessing import TransactionEncoder
   ```

<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>



<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Association Rules & RFM Analysis (Recency, Frequency, Monetary)

Data Preprocessing and transformation - TransactionEncoder class from the MLXtend library
1. To find unique items - flatten the dataframe and convert into a set. The transformation removes any duplicate items
2. Fit the object of the class on the list and convert to dataframe.
3. for every item in a transaction, append 1 if purchased and 0 otherwise. 

 ```python
   # fitting the list and converting the transactions to true and false
   encoder = TransactionEncoder()
   transactions = encoder.fit(matcha_list).transform(matcha_list)
   
   # converting the transactions array to a datafrmae
   df = pd.DataFrame(transactions, columns=encoder.columns_)
   ```
<br>
### Market Basket Analysis

Market Basket Analysis is a data mining tool used by retailers to increase sales by better understanding customer purchasing patterns. 
Purchase history and items bought together are analyzed to reveal product groupings, as well as products that are likely to e purchased together.<br>

### Association Analysis

Association Analysis looks for relationships in large datasets. These relationships can take 2 forms: frequent item sets or association rules.
Frequent item sets are a collection of items that frequently occur together. Association rules suggest that a strong relationship exists between two items

### Frequently bought together
> ![Matcha and Hojicha](https://github.com/JohnTan38/Best-README/blob/master/images/MatchaHojichaLatte_asso.png)
<br>
> Matcha latte and Hojicha latte pair with high level of confidence and lift. Lift > 1 indicates that higher sales of antecedents lead to higher sales of consequents<br>

### Frequently bought together bundle
> ![Chocolate Milk Almond and Matcha Vanilla Latte](https://github.com/JohnTan38/Best-README/blob/master/images/BundleSnacks_asso.png)
<br>
> Chocolate Almond Milk and Matcha Vanilla Latte bundle with high level of confidence and lift.<br>


## RFM Analysis

Customers recency, frequency & monetary (transaction values) are analyzed and K Means clustering used to group customers into distinct segments<br>.
> ![Customer segmentation](https://github.com/JohnTan38/Best-README/blob/master/images/TopCustomers.png)<br>

Customer segmentation fine-tuned with detailed analysis and RFM segments identified. 
For example, top customers who buy frequently and with high ticket values in RFM segment '144' could be offered bundle of 'Awakening Matcha Whisk set' with 
'Ceremonial Uji Matcha Powder'.<br>
> ![RFM segment](https://github.com/JohnTan38/Best-README/blob/master/images/RFM_quartile.png)<br>
